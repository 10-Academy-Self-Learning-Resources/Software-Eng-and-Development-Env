#### What is Software Engineering
As defined by Techopedia, Software engineering is the process of analyzing user needs and designing, constructing, and testing end-user applications that will satisfy these needs through the use of software programming languages like python, c#, java etc. It is the application of engineering principles to software development. In contrast to simple programming, software engineering is used for larger and more complex software systems e.g github, which are used as critical systems for businesses and organizations. It may also involve the process of analyzing existing software, and modifying it to meet current application needs.

#### What is Development Environment
A development environment is a collection of procedures and tools for developing, testing and debugging an application or program. The development environment normally has three server tiers, called development, staging and production. All three tiers together are usually referred to as the DSP.

## When will I use Software Engineerning in my ML career
- When you work on ML projects
- When analyzing user requirements
- When you contribute to Open Source ML projects
- When you work with teams with diverse skills set 

## Why is it important to learn about Software Engineering
- To be able to work with teams effectively and effortlessly
- To allow other people contribute to your work when you Open source it

## How Software Engineering (SE) and Development Environment help solve problems
- Using the practice that SE preach, you can easily implement customers feedback and deliver good product that get good reviews
- It helps to be structured and knows what needs to be done at different stage of the application development

## Examples of how you use Software Engineering today
**Planning** ur day ahead is one way you probably use some technique of SE

## What components makes up Software Engineering
- **Programming Language**: When an application is being created, a developer must choose a language to write the projectâ€™s code with. Just like the languages that form our world, programming languages perform the same purpose but have a different structure and benefit.
- **Platform**: Provides a foundation for the application
- **Framework**: acts as a structure that keeps code simple and consistent
- **Quality Assurance**: (QA) is a set of activities intended to ensure that products satisfy customer requirements in a systematic, reliable fashion.

## What differentiate begineers from experts in Software Engineering
Experts follow the principles of SE for all their projects
